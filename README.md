This provides the primary code, results, and additional information on a project to replicate analysis produced by Sommers, et al. and expanding the analysis to include the Southern States.  

A list of basic analytical steps are:

- [x]	Obtain CDC datasets

- [x]	Fit PS model to Massachusetts with limited dataset

- [x]	Obtain and merge AHRF data with CDC datasets

- [x]	Obtain historical AHRF/ARF data to use as baseline 

- [x]	Fit PS model to Kentucky with full data and create a matching/stratification scheme, first draft 

- [x]	Apply similar analyses as before to Tennessee, first draft

- [x]	Collaborator feedback on PS and post-matching analysis options for KY
